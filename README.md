# SAM3A_Peripheral_Testing_Program on Microchip Studio

This is a simple peripheral test program for the ATSAM3A4CA-CU chip. 

# This is untested
I'm still waiting for the chip

Its highly likely that nothing works atm 

The goal of this is just to test each peripheral to confirm that a correct initializing process was followed

The peripherals I'm trying to test:

the pins and ports used can be found in pio_init.h

PIO - Gerneral Output
USART
I2C
SPI
PWM
DACC
ADC
